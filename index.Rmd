# Introduction

<!-- In their book _Forms That Work_ , Caroline Jarrett and Gerry Gaffney define a form as "a web page that has boxes you can type into".  -->

At its core, the function of a form is to ask questions and record answers given - it's a conversation between two parties.


What makes a good form?

* Helpful
* Transparent
* Short

Who fills out Stanford's forms (who are our users)?

* Students
* Faculty
* Staff

Jarrett & Gaffney describe 3 types of user

* Readers
* Rushers
* Refusers


Is there any data on our users? Can we make any assumptions ?  

They are smart? 

They skew young? 

They WANT to fill out the form (or want the outcome anyway)? Committed to completion?
