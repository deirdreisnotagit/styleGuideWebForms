What makes a good form? Helpful Transparent Short Who fills out Stanford’s forms (who are our users)? Students Faculty Staff Jarrett &amp; Gaffney describe 3 types of user Readers Rushers Refusers Is there any data on our users? Can we make any assumptions ? They are smart? They skew young? They WANT to fill out the form (or want the outcome anyway)? Committed to completion? "],["formDesign.html", "Section 2 Form Design 2.1 Best Practices", " Section 2 Form Design 2.1 Best Practices 2.1.1 Make forms as short as possible Every additional question on a form reduces the completion rate and data quality, while also increasing the rate of errors. Ask yourself if the question/information can be inferred, postponed, or completely excluded.1 2.1.2 Multiple screens or a single page? If there are only one or two topics, a single page form is the way to go. But if a form has multiple sections, multiple pages are required to break up the conversation. Limit the display to five to seven input fields at a given time.2 Find out the most common screen sizes—including mobile and tablet—for your target audience (that is, the sizes that are used by at least 60% of people who’ll use your form). If the form can fit on three or fewer screenfuls of the most common sizes, leave it as one screen. Otherwise, break the form up into separate screens, one step per screen. Avoid having more than seven screens 2.1.3 Keep a single column format Splitting information across 2 or more columns can: add cognitive load for users slow down users of assistive technology make the form harder to use on mobile devices. If you have to use multiple columns, try to keep the same number throughout the form.3 2.1.4 Have a Logical Question Order 2.1.4.1 Follow How the User Thinks The order of questions in your form should, as closely as possible, match the way things flow in the user’s mind (user research is essential for this). 2.1.4.2 Core Before Supplementary Collect the information that’s central to your form’s purpose first, before collecting any supplementary information. That way, the most relevant and important data is provided when the user is freshest and most engaged with the form. Place required fields before optional. 2.1.4.3 Easy Before Difficult Ask simpler and less intrusive questions before complex and more intrusive questions. This eases users into the process instead of bombarding them with hard stuff up front. It also ensures users are more committed before being presented with questions that may otherwise have tempted them to turn away. 2.1.4.4 Keep Related Together The rule of thumb is that more related questions are, the closer they should physically be placed together. (Demographic info, exam results etc) 2.1.5 Use Minimal Color Reserve color for things that need it, so they stand out in some way. Buttons, error messages, links, headings, backgrounds etc are good examples. Be sparing, the more color you use, the less it stands out. Also, you never want to rely solely on color to communicate something in your web form. 2.1.6 Form must be accessible In order to be considered accessible, form components must meet the following success criterion from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines: (WCAG) 2.0: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value: For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links, and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies. The good news is that standard HTML elements already meet these requirements, providing an accessible user experience without additional code to accommodate assistive technology. It is only if you are using custom elements that you will have to implement the guidelines. you are. Assuming your form components are accessible, ???? suggests UX design suggests the following Ensure the form has a proper contrast between foreground and background: Some people cannot read the text if there is not sufficient contrast between the text and the background (see minimum contrast ratio as required by WCAG.) https://uit.stanford.edu/accessibility/concepts/color/checker Allow users to control text size: People with low vision and cognitive disabilities require increased font size to read. A product designer should provide controls that allow the user to incrementally increase or decrease the text size. Screen Reader Enable: Make sure to include the label attribute for screen readers and if if you have different sections in your form, tag the groups for screen readers. Don’t rely on color as the only visual means to communicate status. An estimated eight percent of males and one percent of females are color blind, according to &lt; a href = “https://preventblindness.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/FS56_ColorVision.pdf”&gt;Prevent Blindness, so provide additional identification for color-blind people (e.g. an error message with red text can also contain an exclamation point icon.) 2.1.7 Pre-fill fields when possible Reduce the burden of typing as much as possible. Use pre-filled information if available and appropriate for the user and make use of smart defaults (e.g. If requesting phone # or country can default value based on the user’s IP address). Browsers like Google Chrome &amp; Firefox now have an &lt; a href = “https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input#attr-autocomplete”&gt; auto-fill function that lets users fill out standard form fields in one click. For this to work, they look for contextual clues in the ‘name,’ ‘label,’ and placeholder text. Therefore, it’s good practice to ensure your fields are properly tagged with terms that a browser would recognise e.g. ‘email,’ ‘first name,’ or ‘city.’ 2.1.8 Use Progressive Disclosure (Conditional logic) A form can reveal more content as users go through the form and use its fields and controls. This technique can be used when it is not necessary to see all controls unless users have made specific decisions, for example, if they ticked a particular checkbox additional information would be revealed. 2.1.9 Keep tab order consistent with input order Make sure the user can freely navigate through the form without a mouse (e.g. people with a tablet device or those using screen readers). Match the tab order to the visual order in which questions, buttons and other elements are presented. 2.1.10 Distinguish between Optional and Required fields: Try to avoid optional fields in forms. But if you use them, at least clearly distinguish which input fields may not be left blank. The convention is to use an asterisk (*) for required fields or the word “optional” for non-required fields. You have a choice to indicate the required fields or the optional fields. Jenifer Enders argues the better approach is to only indicate the optional fields, and she recommends the following steps: Have an instruction at the top of each screen that says: “All questions must be answered, unless marked (optional).” Add “(optional)” to the end of the label for every optional question. Don’t add any visual markers to required fields. This method she argues, is highly accessible &amp; usable, in addition to reducing the amount of visual noise. 2.1.11 Align fields “illuminate a clear path to completion. Aligning inputs and actions with a strong vertical axis clearly communicates how to go about completing a form.” 2.1.12 Let the user know where they are Every page should have the form title and you should display step progress for multiple page forms. Use sentence case throughout your form, including headings. 2.1.13 Use a gateway and confirmation screen 2.1.13.1 Gateway screen should contain a title and friendly message followed by a brief description of what the respondent can expect from the form, (if they need any documents, how long to complete etc). Address likely concerns (“No credit card required. Cancel anytime”). 2.1.13.2 Confirmation screen Sends a success or fail message and what to expect next. Thank you for completing, successful submission, next steps. Can also send an email confirmation. If there is a delay after submit, use a processing screen to feedback to the user that something is happening. https://medium.com/nextux/form-design-best-practices-9525c321d759↩︎ https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/principles/web-design/best-practices-form-design/↩︎ https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/forms↩︎ "],["formComponents.html", "Section 3 Form Components 3.1 Component Types", " Section 3 Form Components 3.1 Component Types Engles states the top 3 components to use on a form are: radio buttons checkboxes text boxes for the following reasons: users are familiar with them they work on all screen sizes, including mobile they’re built into the HTML specification they’re accessible they’re simple to use 3.1.1 Input text field 3.1.1.1 Best Practices: 3.1.1.1.1 Use field length as an affordance Match the size of the text input box to the length of the response the user should provide. 3.1.1.1.2 User should be able to judge the state of the field. Field focus should be a visual cue – such as changing the color of the border or background of the selected input field, or showing the cursor in the input field. Think of it as a hint you leave users regarding where they are. 3.1.1.1.3 Say something here like Use appropriate ddd and ssss Specifying an appropriate type attribute (e.g. type=“tel” for telephone number fields) will not only control what input is displayed, but also helps mobile devices select a keyboard layout suitable for entering that type of data. 3.1.1.2 Anatomy of a text box An input text field consists of the following parts: Container/Border Label Placeholder/Input text Trailing icon (Optional element) Helper text/Error text (Optional element) Leading icon (Optional element) 3.1.1.2.1 Container Say something about the container 3.1.1.2.2 Label Top line label improves speed of completion (easy to scan), label to the left improves accuracy. Use sentence case. 3.1.1.2.3 Input text or Placeholder text Use placeholder text for instructions only e.g. Please select… or DD/MM/YYYY. There should be a very clear distinction between the placeholder itself and the value typed by the respondent. If there is not, the respondent might think that the fields with placeholders are already filled fields. 3.1.1.2.4 Icons Icons can be effective labels when they are easy to decipher, either because their meaning is clear or because they are familiar, such as the text formatting icons used on most text editor toolbars. When the meaning is not clear, icons are best paired with descriptive text. The icons are easy to visually scan and recognize, and the text provides additional clarity about the purpose of the control. https://www.webstyleguide.com/7-interface-design.html 3.1.1.2.5 Help text Position the help text between the label and the input field. Don’t use headings, labels or placeholder text for help. text.4 Don’t repeat the label or explain the obvious (eg fill in your first name). 3.1.2 Radio Buttons Radio buttons are used for mutually exclusive choices #### Best Practices: 3.1.2.0.1 All options should be visible. Users must be able to scan and compare options to make an appropriate selection 3.1.2.0.2 Vertically align the buttons When possible, arrange the radio buttons vertically for easier reading. If the choice is limited to binary or opposite (light/dark) options, then they can be aligned horizontally. If you are aligning horizontally, make sure to space the buttons and labels so that it’s abundantly clear which choice goes with which label. 3.1.3 Check Boxes 3.1.4 Dropdowns The better solution is to use a text box with autosuggest. 3.1.5 Links Links should open on a new window to preserve cursor position, and flow of form input Should reflect state (visited, active, focus) 3.1.6 Buttons Short (&lt; 3 word) labels on buttons. A good rule of thumb is to answer the question “I want to…” from the user’s perspective. https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/forms#choose_accessible_form_inputs↩︎ "],["formValidation.html", "Section 4 Form Validation", " Section 4 Form Validation Validation and error messages indicate when a form or field submission fails. There are three messages that validation should convey to the user: An error has occurred: Display clearly that there is an error in the form, e.g. use a red color and/or an icon such as an exclamation mark (“!”) to attract attention. Where the error occurred: Highlight the field(s) that caused the error. Focus the cursor on the field so the user doesn’t have to search for it. How the error can be repaired: Provide information on what needs to be different in order for the field to validate. Provide guidance about what to do in response to the error. All of these components need to be worded in a polite and non-accusatory tone. Avoid phrases like“You did,” “Your action caused.” Some error messages are phrased in a way that accuses the user of making an error; errors are already frustrating, and there’s no need to add to frustration with judgment. In the end, these messages are an important, albeit, small way that we communicate and build relationships with our users. Always focus on the problem, not the user action that led to the problem. Here are two ways you can handle a situation when the user enters incorrect login credentials: Don’t say: You have entered an incorrect login or password. Do say: Your login and password do not match. https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/information-architecture/error-message-design-ux/ 4.0.1 When to validate? Should you validate as the user types or after the user tabs off the field One approach proposes a hybrid — reward early, punish late — model:^https://medium.com/wdstack/inline-validation-in-forms-designing-the-experience-123fb34088ce#.vqbw1xole If the user is entering the data in the field that was in a valid state, perform the validation after the data entry If the user is entering the data in the field that was in an invalid state, perform the validation during the data entry General rules suggested by https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/10615/matt-obee For open-ended questions, give feedback after the user finishes providing an answer (on blur, when they move on to the next field). For questions that the user might need help with sooner (e.g. username and password fields), give feedback while they are typing but use an appropriate delay so that premature error messages don’t frustrate them. https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/74531/form-validation-when-should-error-messages-be-triggered Error and warning messages should disappear when the criteria is met.
